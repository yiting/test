 Converts the duration into seconds and returns it as an NSTimeInterval.

 If you're timing a single event, you can pass the result of a BCDurationSince() call straight into
 this function to get it back as an NSTimeInterval.

 If you're timing a series of events however, it's most efficient to accumulate the total as a BCDuration
 value, and then convert the total once at the end, e.g:

     BCDuration total = 0;
     for (int n 0; n < 100; ++n) {
       BCTime start = BCTimeNow();
       do_some_thing();
       total += BCDurationSince(start);
     }
     return BCTimeIntervalsForDuration(total);

 With this approach, only a single conversion takes place, at the end.
