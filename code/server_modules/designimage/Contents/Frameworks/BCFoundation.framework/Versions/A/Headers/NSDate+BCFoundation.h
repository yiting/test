 Return a date formatter which can output ISO8601 dates.

              - macOS 10.12 helpfully introduces NSISO8601DateFormatter, which will make this obsolete; but we can't use it yet because we're still supporting 10.11.
              - currently this implementation only supports converting from NSDate to NSString; we could add the alternate route if we need it.

 Return this date as an iso8601 formatter.
 
 @discussion  This makes a new formatter every time. For the sake of efficiency, if you're going to
              convert lots of dates, it's better to get a formatter object yourself and use it.
